# Can you catch a cheater?


[Learned League](https://learnedleague.com/thorsten/) is an online trivia league with an inperson component at the end of the season. Much like a sports league, the regular season is online with four seasons a year, 25 days of matches per season, 6 questions per day. And since this is online, the regular season is carried out on the honor code. Top performers qualify for a once a year championship, 4 day live tournament, 12 questions per day. After day 2, the bottom performers are eliminated. With this setup, it is entirely possible for someone to cheat during the regular season and not be punished or detected however the methods used to cheat in the regular season won't be available for them in the final rounds. The question stands, it is possible to determine if there are cheaters in this context and if so can you find them?
